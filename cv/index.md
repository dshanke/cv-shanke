### **Awards & Recognition**

- Received multiple awards at NAB. This also includes an **MVP** (most
  valuable player in last quarter of 2018) and the Quarterly award for
  the quarter in which I revived the database partitioning process and
  for quick fix of a non-severe but irritating bug which was logging
  many incidents against our application and the fix for which was not
  being prioritized due to high estimates that were attached to it.

- Received multiple awards at various levels \[L1/L2/L3/L4 (highest)\]
  at Symantec in Year 2008/2009/2012/2013 for performance and
  pro-actively resolving customer issues.

- Received ‘Valuable contribution Award’, at iGate (Patni) for the
  quarter January 2005 to March 2005 for the contributions made on
  crucial projects.

---
### **Career highlights and achievements**

- Built the Redshift service stack in [ZAZ(Spain)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-region-in-spain/) and
  [ZRH(Zurich)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/a-new-aws-region-opens-in-switzerland/)
  Region.

- Designed and migrated work loads of on-premises application to AWS
  with monitoring, backup and restore solution using AWS services and
  ansible & shell scripts for automation/provisioning, which now allows
  to stand multiple environments at will within matters of few minutes.
  The solution also includes a home-grown Oracle Database on EC2
  solution with ability to create snapshots & restore/recover from those
  snapshots.

- Successfully **designed and implemented** the complex MITR Tax regime
  rules mandated by ATO in Unison Unit Pricing application. Reduced the
  initially estimated waterfall model estimates by 50% by adopting an
  agile prototype driven approach which allowed early testing of
  application.

- Designed and implemented integration of Reputation technologies in
  CSAPI (Content Scanning APIs) component which is the core scanning
  component of Symantec Protection Engine, during a period of resource
  crunch without affecting delivery timelines. While working on this new
  module, detected and fixed an underlying design issue in existing core
  modules due to which files were being copied and scanned more than
  once. This reduced the scan cycles by 30%.

- Enhanced performance by 50% in the Enterprise Security Manager’s
  Account information module by implementing local cached with TTL,
  avoiding redundant LDAP calls.

- Implemented password hash generation algorithm in Sybase 15.x only by
  looking at the somewhat vague documentation provided by Sybase. The
  algorithm was used for detecting weak password using dictionary-based
  cracking.

- Introduced, Conceptualized, and implemented an application module in
  Enterprise Security Manager compliance product which implemented and
  used the VMWare’s vSphere Web service, for the purpose of retrieving
  compliance & security data which help with auditing the VMware
  infrastructure.
